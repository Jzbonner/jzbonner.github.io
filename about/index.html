				<p> I am a rising Senior at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill; and my exepcted graduation is May 2016. 
					After my undergrad I plan to pursue a MSIS graduate degree; which hopefully will better allow me to pursue a
					professional career in Information and Library Science. I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia, and attended high 
					school at the Gwinnett School of Math, Science and Technology. My time at Carolina has been spent in a number of 
					ways. My first few years at Univrsity, I was a part of the <a href="http://cmsp.unc.edu/">Carolina Millennial 
					Scholars Program</a> - an orginization dedicated to creating an open community for incoming male minority students. 
					As a member I participated in peer mentoriship and community service in the Chapel Hill area. Outside of the 
					program I also worked with Habitat for Humanity to help build homes in an attempt to lower the global housing 
					crisis. For a more detailed look at my experience and qualifications, please refer to my resume below.
